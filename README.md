## Goal 

#### The goal is to show an understanding of arrays and looping.
#### By _**{David Butler}**_

## Description
#### Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:

* Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

#### These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third.
